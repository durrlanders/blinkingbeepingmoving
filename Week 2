Took me a while, but I got there.

The soldering was a bit of a learning curve for me. I started by doing it backwards, until my friend Liam pointed it out that I was soldering like a bozo. Here's a pic of the backwards soldering:

taking the solder off was annoying, but I did it.

eventually I got the whole thing soldered on, but I broke my speaker. I grabbed a new speaker.
Here's a video of it working:

Still figuring out an enclosure for it, but the important thing is that it works.
