My two circuits are aptly based on real-life circumstances. 

Pulp Fiction Bleu Series serves as a double entendre of a name for my circuit. Series points out that the photocell and LED are in series, “Bleu” is a reminder of the color of the LED, and the circuit is based on the briefcase in the movie Pulp Fiction. The photocell makes the LED shine brighter when the lid is opened. The video did a poor job capturing the intensity of the LED, but I feel that the circuit did as intended.

Tic Tac Wintergreen No. 7 functions based on the state of the lid. When pressed down, an LED shines, when open, the LED does not shine. The name takes inspiration from from Jackson Pollock and the flavor of Tic Tacs used for this apparatus.
