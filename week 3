This reading reminded me of other readings you assigned in the past. At first, it reminded me of our reading on interaction and later it reminded me of our reading from creative coding, regarding interfaces. I found it interesting going over the history of computer interfaces and I liked how the author pointed out that computers are rarely working at full capacity (I'm definitely the exception to this rule as I frequently have all of the Adobe apps open). I think the section devoted to embodiment as it relates to interaction yielded poignant ideas. It made me think about the setting in which I would view a computer from the beginning of the article. Truthfully, that computer lacks a graphical user interface, and would be referred to as a computer, but would sit in my mind more as a gizmo in a museum. I then built up the reasoning that there are tons of computers that take on new meanings. A digital clock is certainly a computer, but people would look at me funny if I said "I hit snooze too many times on my computer this morning." The same goes for phones and iPads. I do think, that tablets are set to overthrow computers once applications on those devices are better suited for professional work. Tablets lend themselves to better interfaces, given the touchscreen and ability to use a stylus. The newest tablets have wicked processing capabilities. I wonder what will happen to the term "computer" if tablets take their place. Will people refer to tablets as computers? or will the word be a thing of the past?
