I enjoyed how Don Norman portrayed an Israeli scientist hellbent on proving that pretty things do not work better. At work, we use ERP software made by an Israeli dude from Jersey who clearly hates good-looking things. I struggle with this software, and even after learning how to use it, I hate it.

I kept thinking about one of the last points that Norman made; the changing of design standards. For the purpose of this argument, I will call functional design that is pretty “good design”. My take is that good design can never be timeless. Consider the Emeco 1006, a chair that is about as close to timeless as it gets. The 1006 kind of checks all the boxes of Norman’s portrayal of good design. The 1006 is military-grade, comfortable, and light. The 1006 has a rich backstory and is commonly found, it fits in with a variety of trends and rarely goes out of style. That said, the 1006 sucks. If a Barnett Newman painting was a chair, it would be the Emeco 1006. It is timeless because of its lack of character. Design professors often claim that good design is cutting-edge, and I sit in that camp. I think truly good design is trendy because of its daring nature. These trends change over time, often in a cycle. You might not want a chair shaped like a hand, or a bean bag right now, but both tell more about their owner than an Emeco 1006. These chairs lack some of the functionality of the 1006, but they are fun, trendy, and go out of fashion.
